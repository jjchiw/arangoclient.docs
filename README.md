## ArangoDB .Net Documentation

Welcome to the ArangoDB .NET client driver documentation.

This documentation provide guidance on client API usage to work with Documents, Databases, Edges and other parts of ArangoDB. The design of API is similar to [ArangoDB Javascript API](https://docs.arangodb.com/Documents/DatabaseMethods.html) to make it more simple when working with [Transactions](https://docs.arangodb.com/Transactions/README.html) that is accessible through Javascript API.

Currently client supports for LINQ queries, change tracking, streaming data, asynchronous and synchronous api.
